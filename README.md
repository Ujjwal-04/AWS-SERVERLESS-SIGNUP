# 🌐 AWS Static Website + Serverless Sign-Up Form (Free Tier)

This project showcases how to deploy a **fully functional static website** on AWS S3 and connect it to a **serverless sign-up backend** using AWS Lambda and API Gateway — all done inside the AWS Free Tier.

> ⚠️ Note: All AWS resources (S3, Lambda, API Gateway) have been deleted to avoid charges. This repo documents the project step-by-step with code and screenshots.
